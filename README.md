# BC2020-Map-Generator
A map builder created for Battlecode 2020

Use the brushes to edit the map to your liking. Move HQ positions, add water, elevate the land and more!

Then you can download the map by clicking the Download Map button and save it for use in battlecode by storing it in a `maps` folder (create it if you haven't) in the root directory of the battlecode 2020 scaffold.

You can also upload an existing map and edit that as well.
